# Soldier-vs.-Civilian-Embedded-Detection-System
This project implements a complete embedded AI detection pipeline capable of distinguishing between soldiers, civilians, and weapons in real time. The system runs on the Kria KR260 development board, combining YOLOv8 deep learning inference with hardware-level GPIO control for LED and buzzer alerts.
